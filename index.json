Ly𝛼 scattering changes the state of hydrogen and thus affects the 21cm signal through the so-called Wouthuysen–Field effect. While this effect is known since a long time, models studying it are very rudimentary. This is because the range of scales (≪pc mean free path of Ly𝛼 photons to \u0026gt;Mpc coherent regions in the EoR) is simply too large to model the effect correctly.
