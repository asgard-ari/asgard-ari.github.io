      <title>Cold Gas Survival in Galactic Winds</title>
      <link>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/cc-extend/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cold gas clouds embedded in hot galactic winds face rapid destruction through hydrodynamic instabilities and turbulent mixing, yet observations show that such gas can survive over large distances. The balance between mixing and radiative cooling is crucial, but previous work has explored only a narrow region of parameter space (e.g., Mach numbers around ~1.5 and density contrasts of ~100).&lt;br&gt;
In this project, you will run high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations across a broad range of Mach numbers, density contrasts, and cooling efficiencies to determine when and how cold gas can endure. The goal is to produce a survival map of cold clouds in galactic outflows, providing valuable constraints for interpreting observations and improving galaxy-scale models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lyman-alpha as a proxy for ionizing photon escape</title>
      <link>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/lyalyc/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/lyalyc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We know that the Universe turned from neutral to ionized in the so-called &amp;lsquo;Epoch of Reionization&amp;rsquo;. However, we do not know yet how the photons that were responsible for this era escaped their host-galaxies as they can be absorbed by gas already inside the galaxies. Luckily for astrophysics, Lyman-alpha photons are susceptible to the same gas as ionizing photons. In this project, you will run your own radiative transfer simulations to figure out a link between the escape of ionizing and Lyman-alpha photons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a numerical/theoretical thesis with connection to observations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lyman-alpha pumping during the dark ages</title>
      <link>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/lya-pumping/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next generation of telescopes such as the SKA target the 21cm spinflip transition line of neutral hydrogen to map out the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Ly𝛼 scattering changes the state of hydrogen and thus affects the 21cm signal through the so-called Wouthuysen–Field effect. While this effect is known since a long time, models studying it are very rudimentary. This is because the range of scales (≪pc mean free path of Ly𝛼 photons to &amp;gt;Mpc coherent regions in the EoR) is simply too large to model the effect correctly. In this project, you will run Ly𝛼 radiative transfer simulations of models of galaxies and their surroundings, record the scattering rates and try to find prescriptions to model this effect correctly in larger scale EoR simulations where the gas and radiative transfer around galaxies cannot properly be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modeling gas clouds in the vicinity of a black hole</title>
      <link>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/g2-cloud/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/g2-cloud/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gas clouds such as G2 orbit the central supermassive black hole of the Milky Way. On their journey they are subject to extreme gravitational acceleration which disrupts them eventually before the gas reaches the black hole. Counteracting this fragmentation is radiative cooling which &amp;ndash; aided by turbulent mixing &amp;ndash; continuously creates new, cold gas and effectively keeps the gas cloud &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo;.
In this project you will perform hydrodynamical simulations to study the evolution of a gas cloud subject to gravitational fragmentation with the inclusion of gravitational cooling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Radiation Pressure–Driven Acceleration and Survival of Cold Gas</title>
      <link>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/cc-radiation-pressure/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/cc-radiation-pressure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Radiation pressure from young stars or AGN is often invoked as a mechanism to accelerate cold gas, yet its role in enabling — or preventing — the long-term survival of this gas remains poorly understood. Competing processes such as shear, instabilities, and radiative cooling complicate the dynamics, and current theories do not reliably predict when radiation pressure helps preserve clouds versus tearing them apart.&lt;br&gt;
In this project, you will conduct radiation–hydrodynamic simulations to study how cold gas clouds respond to radiation pressure under a range of luminosities, optical depths, and ambient conditions. By identifying the regimes in which clouds accelerate, remain coherent, or fragment, the project will shed light on the physical pathways through which radiation pressure shapes multiphase outflows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stability of Cold Streams in the Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/cold-streams-lss/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/cold-streams-lss/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cold streams are believed to supply a major fraction of the gas that fuels galaxy growth at high redshift, yet their stability as they penetrate the hot circumgalactic medium remains an open question. While analytical models and idealized simulations provide criteria for when streams should survive or fragment, it is unclear how these predictions translate to the complex, dynamical environments found in realistic halos.&lt;br&gt;
In this project, you will use large-volume cosmological simulations to identify and extract cold streams, characterize their thermodynamic and kinematic properties, and systematically compare them to theoretical survival criteria. This work will clarify the physical conditions that regulate stream persistence and help connect idealized stability models to the multiphase structure of the CGM.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The effect of spectral stacking on the information content</title>
      <link>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/stacking/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/stacking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic radiation is our primary window to observe galaxies and to constrain our theoretical models. In particular, resonant lines such as Lyman-alpha or MgII play a pivotal role in astrophysics as a tool to study low surface brightness region such as the circumgalactic medium. As the detection of a single object is so challenging, it is common practice to perform &amp;ldquo;stacking&amp;rdquo; of individual object, thus beating down the noise and enhancing the signal. However, from a theoretical perspective it is unclear what the stacking analysis does to the spectral shape or the information contained in the data.
In this project, we will systematically explore the information content of individual spectra versus stacks. To do so, you will run radiative transfer simulations and assemble individual synthetic spectra, perform a stacking analysis, and build a fitting pipeline to obtain the information contained in the stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thermal Instability and Heating Mechanisms in Stratified Atmospheres</title>
      <link>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/ti-stratified/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/ti-stratified/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thermal instability (TI) in stratified atmospheres is believed to play a central role in producing the cold gas observed in galaxy clusters’ intracluster medium. A key but poorly understood ingredient is the form of heating that balances cooling: previous work has typically assumed highly idealized, spatially uniform “magic heating” to maintain global thermal equilibrium.&lt;br&gt;
In this project, you will explore TI both theoretically and with numerical simulations, replacing such ad hoc heating prescriptions with more realistic, physically motivated models. By mapping how different heating mechanisms influence condensation, stability criteria, and cold-gas morphology, this work will help build a more robust understanding of how multiphase structure forms in cluster atmospheres.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thermal Instability in Turbulent Multiphase Media</title>
      <link>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/ti-turb/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://asgard-ari.github.io/project/ti-turb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thermal instability plays a key role in shaping the multiphase structure of the ISM, CGM, and ICM, yet its onset within turbulent environments remains poorly understood. In supersonic and subsonic turbulence, compressed regions can cool rapidly and condense, but the precise conditions for when and where this occurs are not well established.&lt;br&gt;
In this project, you will perform turbulent-box simulations and follow the thermodynamic trajectories of gas parcels to determine how turbulence seeds and amplifies thermal instability. The goal is to build a predictive framework connecting local dynamical conditions—compression, cooling times, and turbulent driving—to the formation of cold gas in astrophysical environments.&lt;/p&gt;
